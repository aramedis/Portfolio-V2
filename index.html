                <p>Commithub's mission is plex and home automation for only Apple models. Commithub does provide some automation features, but in the long term, we plan on developing a broader API suite to encapsulate the app model and its various modules. Commgithub is the new kid on the block, but its approach is very reminiscent of the early days of Agawi. As the company has grown, Commgithub has also been acquired by Digital Garage, the online design and prototyping marketplace.
